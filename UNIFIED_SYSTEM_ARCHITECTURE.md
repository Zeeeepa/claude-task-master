# Unified AI CI/CD Development Flow System Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for the unified AI CI/CD development flow system that integrates all existing components with new components to provide a complete software development workflow.

## System Components

### 1. System Orchestrator (`src/orchestrator/`)

- Central coordination hub managing all workflows
- Workflow state management
- Component communication
- Task scheduling and prioritization

### 2. Database Management (`src/database/`)

- PostgreSQL as central state store
- Task and workflow persistence
- Performance optimization
- Migration management

### 3. External Integrations (`src/integrations/`)

- **Claude Code**: PR validation and debugging
- **AgentAPI Middleware**: Communication bridge
- **Linear Integration**: Issue management and status updates
- **Codegen SDK**: Real API integration for PR creation

### 4. Deployment Pipeline (`src/deployment/`)

- WSL2 deployment automation
- PR validation environment
- Automated testing and validation

### 5. Natural Language Processing (`src/nlp/`)

- Task-to-PR conversion
- Requirements analysis
- Context understanding

### 6. Monitoring & Performance (`src/monitoring/`)

- Real-time system health tracking
- Performance metrics
- Alerting and notifications

### 7. Security & Compliance (`src/security/`)

- Authentication management
- Security auditing
- Compliance validation

## Workflow Flow

```
Linear Issue → Database Task → NLP Processing → Codegen PR Creation →
Claude Code Validation → WSL2 Deployment → Status Updates → Monitoring
```

## Implementation Strategy

Each component will be implemented as a separate sub-issue with comprehensive requirements and validation cycles.
