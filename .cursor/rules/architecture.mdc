# AI Development Orchestrator Architecture

## Overview

The AI Development Orchestrator is a comprehensive system that bridges Codegen SDK and Claude Code through AgentAPI middleware, providing automated development workflows with event-driven architecture.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Event-Driven Design
- All operations are logged as events in the database
- Real-time state synchronization across components
- Comprehensive audit trail for debugging and compliance
- Event replay capabilities for system recovery

### 2. Microservices Architecture
- Loosely coupled components with well-defined interfaces
- Independent scaling and deployment of services
- Fault isolation and graceful degradation
- Service discovery and health monitoring

### 3. AgentAPI-Centric Communication
- Central middleware for all AI agent interactions
- Request routing and response aggregation
- Load balancing and failover handling
- Authentication and authorization layer
