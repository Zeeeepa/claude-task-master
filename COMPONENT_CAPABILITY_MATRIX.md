## Integration Readiness Summary

### High Integration Potential
- **OpenEvolve ↔ Codegen**: Both have strong API foundations and complementary capabilities
- **Codegen ↔ Claude Code**: Natural workflow from task management to code generation
- **All Three Components**: Shared AI provider support creates common integration points

### Integration Challenges
- **Claude Code Deployment Gap**: Limited deployment automation capabilities
- **OpenEvolve Task Management**: No native task decomposition features
- **Performance Monitoring**: Limited cross-component performance analysis
- **Authentication Coordination**: Need unified authentication across all components

### Recommended Integration Approach
1. **API Gateway Pattern**: Unified entry point for all three components
2. **Event-Driven Communication**: Asynchronous messaging for loose coupling
3. **Shared Configuration**: Common configuration management across components
4. **Progressive Integration**: Start with Codegen ↔ Claude Code, then add OpenEvolve
