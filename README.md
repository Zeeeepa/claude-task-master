# 🔍 OpenEvolve & Component Integration Requirements Analysis

## 📋 Research Overview

This repository contains comprehensive research and analysis for integrating three core components into a unified CI/CD orchestration system:

- **OpenEvolve** (Central Orchestrator) - Evolutionary coding agent for code optimization
- **Codegen** (AI Development Engine) - Python SDK for intelligent code generation  
- **Claude Code** (Validation Engine) - AI-powered task management system
