# Security Incident Response Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the procedures for responding to security incidents in the Claude Task Master system. It provides step-by-step guidance for identifying, containing, investigating, and recovering from security breaches.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

#### Critical (P0)
- Active data breach or unauthorized access
- System compromise with potential data loss
- Complete system unavailability
- Exposure of sensitive credentials or API keys

#### High (P1)
- Suspected unauthorized access
- Partial system compromise
- Failed authentication attacks
- Suspicious activity patterns

#### Medium (P2)
- Policy violations
- Minor security misconfigurations
- Non-critical vulnerability discoveries
- Unusual but not immediately threatening activity

#### Low (P3)
- Security awareness issues
- Minor policy violations
- Informational security events

## Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Detection and Analysis

#### 1.1 Incident Detection
Incidents may be detected through:
- Automated security alerts
- Audit log analysis
- User reports
- External notifications
- System monitoring

#### 1.2 Initial Assessment
```bash
# Check security framework status
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/security/status

# Generate immediate security report
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/security/report?days=1

# Check for failed authentication attempts
grep "failed_login" logs/audit/audit-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).jsonl
```

#### 1.3 Incident Classification
- Determine severity level
- Assess potential impact
- Identify affected systems
- Estimate scope of compromise

#### 1.4 Incident Declaration
For P0/P1 incidents:
1. Notify incident response team
2. Activate incident response procedures
3. Begin documentation
4. Start communication plan

### Phase 2: Containment

#### 2.1 Immediate Containment
```javascript
// Disable compromised user accounts
await authManager.logout(sessionId, userId);

// Revoke all tokens for user
await authManager.revokeAllTokens(userId);

// Block suspicious IP addresses
// Add to security config or firewall rules
```

#### 2.2 System Isolation
```bash
# Stop affected services
systemctl stop task-master-api

# Block network access if needed
iptables -A INPUT -s SUSPICIOUS_IP -j DROP

# Preserve system state for investigation
cp -r /var/log/task-master /incident-response/logs-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

#### 2.3 Evidence Preservation
```bash
# Create forensic image of logs
tar -czf incident-logs-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).tar.gz logs/

# Preserve audit logs
cp logs/audit/* /incident-response/audit-logs/

# Capture system state
ps aux > /incident-response/processes-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).txt
netstat -tulpn > /incident-response/network-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).txt
```

### Phase 3: Investigation

#### 3.1 Log Analysis
```javascript
// Query audit logs for suspicious activity
const suspiciousLogs = await auditLogger.queryLogs({
  startDate: incidentStartTime,
  level: 'critical',
  category: 'authentication'
});

// Analyze failed login attempts
const failedLogins = await auditLogger.queryLogs({
  event: 'failed_login',
  startDate: last24Hours
});

// Check for privilege escalation
const privilegeChanges = await auditLogger.queryLogs({
  event: 'role_change',
  startDate: lastWeek
});
```

#### 3.2 Credential Analysis
```javascript
// Check for compromised credentials
const rotationStatus = await credentialManager.checkRotationNeeded();

// List all credential access
const credentialAccess = await auditLogger.queryLogs({
  category: 'data',
  event: 'secret_retrieved'
});

// Verify credential integrity
const credentials = await credentialManager.listSecrets();
```

#### 3.3 System Analysis
```bash
# Check for unauthorized changes
find /app -type f -mtime -1 -ls

# Analyze network connections
ss -tulpn | grep LISTEN

# Check running processes
ps aux | grep -v "^\[" | sort
```

### Phase 4: Eradication

#### 4.1 Remove Threats
```javascript
// Rotate all potentially compromised credentials
const providers = ['anthropic', 'openai', 'perplexity', 'google'];
for (const provider of providers) {
  await credentialManager.rotateSecret(`${provider.toUpperCase()}_API_KEY`);
}

// Update webhook secrets
await credentialManager.rotateSecret('GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET');
await credentialManager.rotateSecret('LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET');

// Generate new JWT secret
const newJwtSecret = crypto.randomBytes(64).toString('hex');
await credentialManager.setSecret('JWT_SECRET', newJwtSecret);
```

#### 4.2 Patch Vulnerabilities
```bash
# Update dependencies
npm audit fix

# Apply security patches
npm update

# Review and update security configuration
```

#### 4.3 Strengthen Security
```javascript
// Enable additional security measures
SecurityConfig.authentication.maxLoginAttempts = 3;
SecurityConfig.authentication.lockoutDuration = '30m';
SecurityConfig.api.rateLimiting.maxRequests = 50;

// Add IP restrictions
SecurityConfig.network.allowedIPs = ['trusted.ip.range'];
```

### Phase 5: Recovery

#### 5.1 System Restoration
```bash
# Restart services with new configuration
systemctl start task-master-api

# Verify system functionality
curl -f http://localhost:3000/health

# Test authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"newpassword"}'
```

#### 5.2 Monitoring Enhancement
```javascript
// Increase audit logging verbosity
SecurityConfig.audit.logLevel = 'debug';

// Enable additional monitoring
SecurityConfig.audit.events.push('credential_access', 'permission_check');

// Set up real-time alerting
const criticalEvents = ['failed_login', 'permission_denied', 'credential_access'];
// Configure alerting system for these events
```

import { auditLogger, securityFramework } from './security/index.js';

async function detectIncidents() {
  const last5Minutes = new Date(Date.now() - 5 * 60 * 1000);
  
  // Check for multiple failed logins
  const failedLogins = await auditLogger.queryLogs({
    event: 'failed_login',
    startDate: last5Minutes.toISOString(),
    limit: 100
  });
  
  // Group by IP address
  const ipCounts = {};
  failedLogins.forEach(log => {
    const ip = log.data.ip;
    ipCounts[ip] = (ipCounts[ip] || 0) + 1;
  });
  
  // Alert on suspicious activity
  for (const [ip, count] of Object.entries(ipCounts)) {
    if (count >= 10) {
      await triggerIncident('brute_force_attack', {
        ip,
        attemptCount: count,
        timeWindow: '5 minutes'
      });
    }
  }
}

async function triggerIncident(type, data) {
  auditLogger.log('system', 'security_incident_detected', {
    incidentType: type,
    data,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
  
  // Send alerts (email, Slack, etc.)
  await sendAlert(`Security incident detected: ${type}`, data);
}

// Run every 5 minutes
setInterval(detectIncidents, 5 * 60 * 1000);
```

#### Automatic Containment
```javascript
// automated-containment.js
import { authManager, auditLogger } from './security/index.js';

async function autoContainment() {
  // Check for accounts with too many failed attempts
  const suspiciousAccounts = await identifySuspiciousAccounts();
  
  for (const account of suspiciousAccounts) {
    // Temporarily lock account
    await authManager.lockAccount(account.username, '1h');
    
    auditLogger.log('system', 'automatic_account_lock', {
      username: account.username,
      reason: 'excessive_failed_logins',
      lockDuration: '1h',
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  }
}
```
