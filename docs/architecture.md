# Task Master Architecture Documentation

## Overview

Task Master is an AI Development Orchestrator that bridges Codegen SDK and Claude Code through AgentAPI middleware. It provides a comprehensive system for managing AI-driven development workflows with automated task coordination, event processing, and deployment validation.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Orchestrator Layer (`src/orchestrator/`)

**System Watcher** (`system-watcher.js`)
- Monitors system health and status
- Tracks active processes and workflows
- Implements health check endpoints
- Collects system metrics

**Coordination Engine** (`coordination-engine.js`)
- Manages AI agent coordination
- Handles task routing between agents
- Implements load balancing logic
- Tracks agent status and availability

**Event Dispatcher** (`event-dispatcher.js`)
- Routes events between system components
- Implements event queuing and processing
- Handles event prioritization and filtering
- Provides event history and analytics

**Workflow Manager** (`workflow-manager.js`)
- Controls development pipeline flow
- Manages workflow state transitions
- Handles workflow dependencies
- Implements recovery mechanisms

#### 2. Middleware Layer (`src/middleware/`)

**AgentAPI** (`middleware/agentapi/`)
- HTTP server for AI agent communication
- WebSocket support for real-time communication
- Session management for agent interactions
- Message processing and routing

**Codegen Integration** (`middleware/codegen/`)
- SDK client for Codegen API integration
- Authentication and token management
- Repository operations and Git integration
- Pull request creation and management

#### 3. Database Layer (`src/database/`)

**Models** (`database/models/`)
- Requirements definitions and tracking
- Task hierarchies and dependencies
- System events and audit logs
- Linear-Task correlations

**Services** (`database/services/`)
- Event storage with indexing
- Requirement parsing and analysis
- Analytics and reporting
- Migration management

#### 4. Utility Layer (`src/utils/`)

**Configuration Manager** (`config-manager.js`)
- Centralized configuration loading
- Environment variable handling
- Configuration validation
- Hot configuration reloading

**Logger** (`logger.js`)
- Structured logging with levels
- Log rotation and archiving
- Performance logging
- Error tracking integration

**Error Handler** (`error-handler.js`)
- Centralized error handling
- Error categorization and routing
- Recovery mechanisms
- Error reporting and alerting

## Data Flow

### 1. Task Submission Flow

```
User/System → AgentAPI → Coordination Engine → Agent Assignment → Task Execution
```

1. Task submitted via AgentAPI HTTP/WebSocket endpoint
2. Coordination Engine receives and queues task
3. Load balancer selects appropriate agent
4. Task assigned to agent with context
5. Agent executes task and reports progress
6. Results processed and stored

### 2. Event Processing Flow

```
Event Source → Event Dispatcher → Event Handlers → Database Storage → Analytics
```

1. Events generated by system components
2. Event Dispatcher receives and categorizes events
3. Events routed to appropriate handlers
4. Event data stored in database
5. Analytics services process event data

### 3. Workflow Execution Flow

```
Workflow Template → Workflow Instance → Step Execution → Dependency Resolution → Completion
```

1. Workflow created from template
2. Steps initialized with dependencies
3. Steps executed in dependency order
4. Results passed between steps
5. Workflow completion or failure handling
